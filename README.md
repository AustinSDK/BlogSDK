# BlogSDK
Is a blogging website prioritized on anything and everything; But with very limited amount of editors :(

## Install
- To install this beauty, you will first have to download the repo to your device, you do so however you desire.

- After the source code is downloded, you will install all the required packages (you need a node packet manager, npm is the only offical packet manager of blogsdk)
```bash
npm i
```

- After installing the required libraries, edit the posts or make your own post inside of `./posts`, photos and anything else may be stored on `./src/fraw/` and can be accessed directly.

- Finally, when you are ready to build, you can use the npm build script
```bash
npm run build
```

- Lastly, you now have an awesome website.
