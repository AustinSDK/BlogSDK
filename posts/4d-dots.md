## How..?
&emsp;To start off, this is a very bare bones summary of visualization of 4D, and for more "accurate" information, [Alan Zucconi made an excellent blog on the subject](https://www.alanzucconi.com/2023/07/06/understanding-the-fourth-dimension/)!
Anyways, let's start with 0D, 0D is often considered the lowest level of visualization, solely due to the fact that it consists of a single dot per subspace.
Next, is 1D, imagine putting 10 0D dots onto a line in a row, then you would have a 1D line. Now, put 9 more dots on each line going perpendicular to the original row of dots. You will now have a 2D line inside of the subspace. Let's do a similar step to the previous step again, grab the current 2D platform, and bring it towards the camera 10 more dots. Now we have a 3D subspace. Now finally, for every single existing dot so far, put a duplicate of the subspace into every single one of those dots, but it's the same size as the original subspace, and isnt in it, but beside it; or to continue the streak, putting 10 3D subspaces side to side, perpendicular again.
